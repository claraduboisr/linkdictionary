### 1. General information
 * **Instructions**: Create a JAVA project to manage a dictionary built using _Linked lists_.
 * **Functionalities required**: 
   * The application will open and read line by line a file called _**"unsorteddict.txt"**_ (a collection of words where each line contains a word).
   * The application will read a new word each time a new line is read.
   * Each time a new line is read, the new word will be inserted in the correct position of a data structure called “dictionary” that will be of a Linked list type.
   * The created “dictionary” will be a sorted list of all the words read from the file.
   * After the “unsorteddict.txt” has been fully read, the application will create another file called “sorteddict.txt” which will contain all the words (one word per line) alphabetically ordered.
